## About The Project

![Battleship](assets/battleship.png "battleship text-mode poster")

Battleship Game Engine (BGE) implements the classic turn-based board game as a package that's separated from any presentation layer. This is a type of architectural pattern that useful in many application since it allows any number of apps to utilize the same service.

The BGE itself is invoked through a series of function calls rather than through directly coupled end user actions. In this respect using the BGE is is similar to using an API or a series of routes exposed by a web server.

This challenge requires that you develop the BGE and a very thin, text-based presentation layer for testing that's separate from the engine itself. Due to this the User Stories below are divided two sets - one for the BGE and one for the text-based presentation layer.

BGE is responsible for maintaining game state.
